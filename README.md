📊 Project Overview: Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch, covering both basic and regularized versions. The implementation includes two practical applications:
🎯 Applications

University Admission Prediction

Predicts student admission based on two exam scores
Binary classification problem
Demonstrates linear decision boundary


Microchip Quality Assurance

Determines if microchips pass quality tests
Uses polynomial feature mapping
Implements regularized logistic regression to prevent overfitting



🛠️ Key Implementations
Core Functions Implemented:

Sigmoid Function: Converts linear outputs to probabilities
Cost Function: Calculates logistic regression cost with cross-entropy
Gradient Computation: Computes gradients for parameter optimization
Regularized Versions: Prevents overfitting with L2 regularization
Prediction Function: Makes binary predictions using learned parameters

📈 Mathematical Concepts Covered:

Sigmoid activation function: σ(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z))
Cross-entropy loss function
Gradient descent optimization
Feature mapping for non-linear boundaries
L2 regularization
